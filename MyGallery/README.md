# MyGallery CTF Challenge

Hey, I created *MyGallery*, a cool photo gallery to share and enjoy awesome pictures! Upload your favorite snapshots and check out what others have posted. But here’s the catch—a hidden flag is stashed somewhere in the system! Can you spot the glitch in how *MyGallery* handles photo data to grab the flag?
